Egnyte SDK
=============

## Features

This package contains:

 - a JavaScript wrapper on Egnyte Public API with methods for working with File System API and Link API 
 - a file picker implementation working on top of the File System API
 - a file picker helper to pick files from Egnyte without using the Public API
 

## Usage

`dist/` contains two builds:
 - `dist/egnyte.js` (31KB minified) is the complete functionality
 - `dist/slim.js` (10KB minified) is only the API wrapper

To use the SDK, just add the script to your app's HTML document.

See `docs/` or explore:
